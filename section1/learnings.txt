Javascript is important as it's add business logic to the request-response process.

It makes the process much easier than the tradiitonal web development process

Imperative approach - instructions after instructions [this is the limit of JS]

and that's why React came to the picture

React makes complex UI easier by giving higher level syntax in a declarative way
With the help of custom hTML  element 

React can be used to control parts of the HTML pages or the full page 
And also, it can be used for full frontend application [spa - server only sends one html page and thereafter react will take care of it]

tips for best outcome:

watch videos at your own pace
repeat the lecture, if you needed
code along and practise
pausing and do your own first
try rebuilding your own and then resume the video
practice is most important
we will face errors and debug the errors on your own
DO your own first
use code attachments and compare the code your own and the tutor
narrow down the issues 
as a developer , you should solve problem on your own

help each other and learn together

post on Q&A and also help others
