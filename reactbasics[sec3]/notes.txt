react is all about components

reusability

sepearation of concerns


mostly , react is the combination of html and js
react allows to create reusable & reactive components [consists of html, js and css]



for simple paragraph in js, we need to write:

const para = document.createElement('p');
para.textContent = "This is paragraph"
document.getElementById('root').append(para);

this is imperative

a component in react is just a js function

.toISOString() - a built in method for the Date object
const expenseDate = new Date();
expenseDate.toISOString()
o/p as a string


We can't use our custom defined components as a wrapper around other components

{props.children}
Children is a reserved name and the value of this special children prop 
will always be the content between the opening and closing tags of your custom component.
In our example is the <Card>
